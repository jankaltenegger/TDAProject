# TDAProject

Combining Topology and Data Analysis, this project is utilizing the python library suite "scikit-tda", consisting of Ripser.py, PerSim, Kepler Mapper, etc.

 - Ran tests in Jupyter Notebook getting to know each of the packages and their use cases.
 - Generating graphs and seeing what shapes are created by using various topological methods.
 - Working closely with a math professor at Georgia Gwinnett College, to further enhance my own mathematical understanding.
 - Currently in progress: Running tests with the common "Iris Flower" test data set.
